# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
This repository contains all the material for the Coursera course "Data Analyst" from IBM. The course is focused on teaching the skills needed to become a data analyst, including data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

As I continue the course, I will be uploading additional materials such as code, Jupyter notebooks, and project files.

The materials in this repository are organized by module, with each module containing a set of files and resources specific to that module's content.

If you are a student in the course, please feel free to use this repository as a resource while you work on the course projects. If you are not a student in the course, you are welcome to use the materials in this repository as a learning resource, but please note that they are intended for educational purposes only and may not be used for commercial purposes.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need help with the materials in this repository.
